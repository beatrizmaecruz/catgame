# catgame
This was a purely Python terminal game for a university course assignment in 2023.
We had to show we could code in Python by constructing a very simple card sorting game.
Then, we had to put a creative spin on it called AssignmentCooler.
Here was my assignment submission.

To game is purely played in a terminal.
1. Download CatGame.py.
2. Direct your terminal to the folder with CatGame.py
   <br> &nbsp; ```$ cd folder```
2. Run the script.
    <br>&nbsp; On Windows: ```$ python CatGame.py```
    <br>&nbsp; On Mac: $ ```python3 CatGame.py```
