# catgame
This was a purely Python terminal game for a university course assignment in 2023.
We had to show we could code in Python by constructing a very simple card sorting game.
Then, we had to put a creative spin on it called AssignmentCooler.
Here was my assignment submission.

To game is purely played in a terminal.
1. Download the CatGame folder.
2. Direct your terminal to the folder with CatGame.py [ $cd folder ]
2. Run the script.
    On Windows: $ python CatGame.py
    On Mac: $ python3 CatGame.py
